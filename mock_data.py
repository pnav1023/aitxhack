mock_data = ["""- **Ankylosing Spondylitis (AS)**: HLA-B27 is most strongly associated with ankylosing spondylitis, a chronic inflammatory arthritis affecting the axial skeleton  [6] [5] [12]. AS is characterized by inflammatory back pain, sacroiliitis, and can lead to axial fusion and deformity  [12].

- **Spondyloarthropathies (SpA)**: HLA-B27 is linked to a group of interrelated inflammatory conditions known as spondyloarthropathies, which include psoriatic arthritis, reactive arthritis, and arthritis associated with inflammatory bowel disease  [9] [8] [11]. These conditions share features like inflammatory back pain, asymmetric arthritis, and enthesitis  [9].

- **Uveitis**: HLA-B27 is associated with acute anterior uveitis, which is a common form of intraocular inflammation  [7]. Patients with HLA-B27-associated uveitis often have systemic comorbidities like AS, and the presence of systemic disease can increase the likelihood of recurrent uveitis episodes  [12.3][1].

- **Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD)**: There is a notable association between HLA-B27 and inflammatory bowel diseases such as Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, which can also present with arthritis  [2] [9].

- **Reactive Arthritis**: Also known as Reiter's syndrome, reactive arthritis is another condition associated with HLA-B27, often triggered by infections and characterized by arthritis, urethritis, and conjunctivitis  [9] [10].

- **Psoriatic Arthritis**: This form of arthritis, associated with psoriasis, is also linked to HLA-B27 and can present with both axial and peripheral joint involvement  [9] [11].

- **Genetic and Environmental Factors**: The pathogenesis of HLA-B27-associated conditions involves genetic predispositions and environmental triggers, such as microbial dysbiosis and gut inflammation  [8] [13]. The role of the immune system, particularly the involvement of CD4+ T cells and antigen-presenting cells, is critical in these diseases  [3].

- **Global Prevalence**: The prevalence of HLA-B27 varies globally, influencing the patterns of associated diseases like uveitis  [12.2][4].

"""- **Obesity**: The ADRB3 Trp64Arg polymorphism has been associated with obesity in some populations, such as Japanese adults and Chinese men, but not in others, including Polish, Dutch, and certain Mexican populations  [6.7][2] [6.3][5] [6.1][6]. The mutation may affect lipolysis and thermogenesis, contributing to obesity  [4.4][1] [5.2][8].

- **Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM)**: The Trp64Arg polymorphism has shown associations with higher fasting plasma glucose and HDL-C levels in Brazilian-Caucasian T2DM patients, but not with the overall incidence of T2DM  [1.1][10] [9].

- **Coronary Artery Disease (CAD)**: The association between the Trp64Arg polymorphism and CAD is inconsistent, with some studies showing a link in Asian populations but not in Caucasians  [4.1][3] [4.4][1].

- **Hypertension and Insulin Resistance**: The Trp64Arg variant has been linked to hypertension and insulin resistance in some studies, although results are mixed and may depend on ethnicity and other factors  [4.4][1] [6.2][4].

- **Metabolic Syndrome**: There is evidence suggesting an association between the Trp64Arg polymorphism and metabolic syndrome in certain populations, such as Chinese men  [6.7][2].

- **Dyslipidemia**: Higher ADRB3 DNA methylation levels, which are influenced by the Trp64Arg polymorphism, have been associated with dyslipidemia in familial hypercholesterolemia and obesity  [2.1][7] [5.1][11].

"""- **Vitamin C**: Oral supplementation of 500 mg vitamin C daily has been shown to significantly increase global DNA methylation levels in patients, including those with severe vitamin C deficiency  [4.2][1] [4.4][2]. This suggests that vitamin C can enhance the methylation of DNA, potentially including HLA-B27.

- **Vitamin D**: There is evidence suggesting that vitamin D plays a role in immune modulation and response, which could indirectly affect DNA methylation processes  [8.3][3] [8.4][5]. However, specific studies on vitamin D's direct impact on HLA-B27 methylation are not provided in the context.

- **Calcium**: Supplemental calcium has shown promise in reducing colitis severity in HLA-B27 transgenic rats, which might be related to its effects on mucosal irritation and extracellular matrix remodeling  [7]. While this does not directly address methylation, it suggests a potential area for further research.

- **General Methylation Insights**: Elevated levels of hypermethylated DNA have been associated with increased leukocyte counts and inflammation in AS patients, indicating a potential link between methylation and disease pathogenesis  [2.3][4] [2.2][6].

These supplements, particularly vitamin C, show potential in influencing DNA methylation, which could be relevant for HLA-B27. Further research is needed to confirm these effects specifically on HLA-B27 methylation.

"""- **Folic Acid**: Higher serum folic acid concentrations are associated with lower DNA methylation levels of the ADRB3 gene in eutrophic adults. Specifically, an increase of 1 ng/ml in folic acid levels results in a 2.27% decrease in methylation levels  [3.4][1] [3.3][2].

- **Vitamin B12**: Vitamin B12, along with folic acid, is involved in one-carbon metabolism, which is crucial for DNA methylation. Studies have shown that vitamin B12 can influence gene-specific DNA methylation  [4.2][4] [5.1][5].

- **Methionine**: Methionine is a primary donor of methyl groups for DNA methylation. It is converted to S-adenosylmethionine (SAM), which facilitates the methylation reaction  [6].

- **Choline and Betaine**: These nutrients are also involved in one-carbon metabolism and have been shown to affect DNA methylation. A promethylation cocktail including choline, betaine, folic acid, and vitamin B12 has been shown to produce epigenetic alterations  [6.1][7].

- **Riboflavin and Pyridoxine**: High dietary intake of riboflavin and pyridoxine has been associated with changes in DNA methylation, although their specific impact on ADRB3 methylation is not well-documented  [5.2][3].
