**About**: Welcome to HealthAssess, your personal chat assistant to help you reach your genetic potential.

## How to Use the Web App:

1. Provide your name, email, and DNA. Use one of the provided DNA files we have in the tests folder.
2. Allow time for the models to run, this will take around 60 seconds.
3. Check out your insights and links to supplement products! Then take advantage of the chat bot to ask more personalized questions about your DNA. You could ask anything, but here are some examples to get you started:
   - What are the potential drawbacks of these supplements?
   - Summarize my DNA in a few sentences.

## Limitations (and Things We Would Like to Accomplish in the Future):

- We would like to improve latency from 60 seconds. We can improve our scraper by using Expected Conditions rather than coded waits.
- We could improve the UI, make it more readable.
